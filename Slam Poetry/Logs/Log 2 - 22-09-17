This week I wrote a poem about thoughts and the mind, titled, "Thoughts". I accidently wrote it on word instead of github so there is no commit trail to it. my next poem hasn't been titled yet.
i intend to work on future poems on github starting with my next poem. none of the poems i place on here will be the most final copy and i will probably edit them over and over again over time.
