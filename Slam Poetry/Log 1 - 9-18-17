This is the first log of many that will document the progress of various poems and etc. 
To begin all of my past work will be uploaded on here.
the goal is to have a new poem every week, if not then it is to have a new project every week.
the poetry won't nesecarily be world class, however the purpose of this excercise is to look at and expeirence a different form of expression.
