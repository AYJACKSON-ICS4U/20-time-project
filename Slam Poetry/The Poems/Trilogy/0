The clown of the town
The clown of the town 
A girl was crowned the clown of the town 
Now crowned, she was bound 
Now bound she frowned 
When she frowned 
The mountains painted the sky brown 
The clouds would cry with forces profound 
These storm shook their souls 
Molding and upholding 
The curse by which she was bound 
Was now her newfound freedom 
And now they would plead her 
To leave the crown 
For now hounds had killed these people 
And how the bled 
And how they fed
And now the children were no longer tucked into bed 
This girl cried 
As she woke from her dream 
Knowing what it means 
Because in reality all that she had been 
And all that she had seen 
Had led her to believe 
That she was not free 
But she was wrong 
And that dawn 
She stood strong 
Singing a new song 
A song unheard.
