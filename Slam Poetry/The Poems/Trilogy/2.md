Do you know the boy?
The boy with bloodied hands
The boy that listened to the girl as she sang 
The boy wishing he was a man 
Hands bloodied by those who left 
The hands that kept to the silence 
Watching the girl fighting absent of her own joy 
But this boy who watched ever so carefully 
Wished to never see his hands sullied with her blood
Even as he watched them lower her into the mud 
Even as he was the only one that stood at this funeral 
In his usual apparel 
The boy was careful with the first note 
That left his heavy throat when he first began to sing the song that she had once sang 
And now for the first time the boy felt as if he was a man
