A girl always sang a song 

But she didn’t sing like everyone else

And there were no hearts that melted

And no people that truly felt it 

Even though it surrounded them 

They always forgot 

The joy that she had brought

And her soul which rot

Stuck in this endless rut 

Which set rust to her bones 

Burning her home

Yet the people forgot 

See this girl didn’t have much of a presence 

Most people found her unpleasant 

Because she was restless 

But still the girl sang

In an attempt to rest their heavy bones 

Yet wherever she went she was branded as the one that broke bones 

This girl, 

Ever alone,

No gem or pearl,

With broken bones 

Still she sang 

Until the day she hanged 

Off the fan

Oh man oh man they cried 

Children’s eyes they would hide 

Because this girl left a note

Sweet as an ice cream cone 

For even in her death the girl sang her song

Even though she didn’t belong 

Because 

This song she sang

Kept others from hanging.
