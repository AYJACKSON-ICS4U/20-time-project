## **Will**
*By: Ayesha Khan*


A will to live. 

The desire to fill the plot holes of our lives

To make the most of our time 

To never stop pining forwards

Always finding ways to make ourselves immortals 

To burn our names into history books 

Or the crook of some guys mind 

In the form of a fruitful memory 

Tryna prove that our existence 

Is something worth reminiscing 

Always persisting against life in all of its miserable glory 

All in order to write a story worth reading 

A will to live 

Also known as mankind’s flame 

The flame behind fame 

The flame that lets us burn past the pain 

Never letting us die in vain 

The flame so easily extinguished in summer rain 

Smothered, the embers will still burn 

Ever so slowly and quietly 

In these times you feel less than mighty 

And are willing to give up and stop fighting 

But like kites in the sky you begin to fly

The wind picks up and lightly

 the embers begin to light the
 
tinder and another flame burns ever so slightly 

As the smoke rises once again you’re greeted with the familiarity 

That accompanies the scent of the rust as it burns from your bones 

Reminding you of a home once lost and forgotten.
