Thoughts.
things that brought nightmares
Things that made you think till the brink
Where you wouldn’t dare to blink
Cause your mind plays your dismay a fanfare
But you’ve already been there 
And you know that it’s unfair 
But you don’t care,
Because thoughts,
Also brought the flame with which you fought 
Kept the blame from letting you rot
Where you almost forgot that this world is bare
Bare of all things nice 
Like spice
And the calm of the night air
Making your mind a secret lair 
Where you try to not fret
About how you aren’t perfect 
But try as you may cause your brain is the master of rejection 
And much faster when dissecting 
Every line, and action 
And your body is left as an attraction 
Where the impact is left to be seen by the world 
A world lacking of morals
But worry not people never look past that floral dress you’re wearing 
Never seeing the burden you bear and 
The pain that scars your fare skin 
But this is where the beauty of it all comes in 
You wouldn’t dare to give in 
Never letting the demons win 
Maybe always fakin it 
But you and I both know it 
That in your lair you’re baking it
A plan,
That proves that you can. 
And will.
