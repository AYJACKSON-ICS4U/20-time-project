Trust.
Just what is it?
Mankind always makes a fuss 
Says that it’s a must 
But 
In the huts we call our homes
It’s well known that not everyone in there we trust.
It’s like the crust of a pie
Plain and dry
But it holds together everything that’s inside 
Everything that we hide 
Inside our eyes 
And goodbyes
But let’s not lie 
Trust is nothing more than complementary 
Never once will it be primary 
And it will always be forgotten 
Often left to rust away 
Over the many decades 
With the once friendly faces 
But in rare cases 
Trust is more than the crust
It’s every part of us 
And Every muscle and tissue
Aches with the issue 
That everyone we know treats it as if it’s one time use 
Something to use and abuse 
Then to dispose of 
Never letting it expose us 
Never letting the truth pass those eyes
Letting the mistrust to thrust it’s way past the truth
