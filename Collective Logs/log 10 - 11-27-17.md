### Log 10:
 *By: Ayesha Khan*
 
 
 This is the log for 25/11/17. I started yet another project to replace the poem be in the place of the poem repo since I haven't had any inspiration for it. The new repo will be about me learning korean. So far, I can more or less read korean although I don't quite know what it is that I'm saying. For more details go to the repo labelled Korean.



I glued together the pieces for the design piece and cut them to length. The photo collection is in my design piece repo folder, but, here is the image for the progress:
