 This is the log for 25/11/17. I started yet another project to replace the poem be in the place of the poem repo since I haven't had any inspiration for it. The new repo will be about me learning korean. So far, I can more or less read korean although I don't quite know what it is that I'm saying. For more details go to the repo labelled Korean.
