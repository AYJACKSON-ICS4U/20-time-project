I have begun working on my second project I have changed the original plan to something different. I have glued together and cut my pieces and have begun the designing and planning process. I'm hoping to have a carved piece by the end of this week. 
I have had absolutely no inspiration for the poems and have essentially given up on them. The first design piece is more or less complete and the intend to post the pictures sometime this week.
The Korean is going smoothly, I have been practicing how to read it although, aside from a few words I still don't know what I'm reading means.

I have to begin making my presentation for this assignment, I intend to briefly go through each project and speak about why I dropped some of the projects partway through (A.K.A Poems).

:)

Here is the picture for the original design:
