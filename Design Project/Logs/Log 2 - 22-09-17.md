I have made substantial progress on the peice and have taken photos of it to show my progress. however I can't seem to be able to figure out how to upload photos on here.
Once I'm able to figure it out I will upload all of my progress with the various photos and etc. So far, I have cut out most of the shape using the scroll saw there is a small piece left, however, because of the size of the design piece I am not allowed to cut it, I have asked Mr. Heidt and he has agreed to help me with cutting it and I am now waiting to see for a good time to cut it.
